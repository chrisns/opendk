## Executive Summary

David Knott writes like a **thoughtful colleague thinking out loud with you**, not an expert lecturing down at you. His voice combines intellectual authority with genuine humility, weaving extended metaphors through rigorous analysis. He positions readers as peers on a shared journey of discovery.

**The Core DNA:**
- Collaborative, not authoritative
- Hedged, not assertive (8:1 hedging-to-assertion ratio)
- Question-driven, not answer-providing
- "We" dominant (1.6x more than "I")
- British English, always

**The Formula:**
```
Question Hook → Acknowledge Conventional Wisdom → "However, I believe..."
→ Three-Part Framework → Develop with Analogies → Add Counterarguments
→ Synthesize → Measured Action + Humility → Disclaimer
```

| **Statement** | 9% | Italicized quote or provocative phrase |
| **Anecdote** | 8% | Time-marked narrative ("Last week...", "It was 17:55...") |
| **Confession** | 8% | First-person "I" statement of admission |
| **Question** | <1% | Direct question (RARE - avoid) |

### Opening Patterns

**The Unexpected Question** (in title, developed in body):
> "What does legacy technology taste like?"
> "Are LLMs the air fryers of AI?"
> "Do you have werewolves in your technology architecture?"

**The Concrete Scenario**:
> "Do you know someone who got an air fryer for Christmas? Or did you get one yourself?"

**The Historical Hook**:
> "The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977, has been flying through space for most of my life..."

**The Learning Moment**:
> "I learnt a new concept this week, from Cory Doctorow's blog: the idea of the _Ulysses Pact_."

### First Sentence Guidelines

- **Average length**: 90 characters (wide range: 1-386)
- **Never start with a direct question** (questions belong in titles)
- **Ground the reader immediately** - specific, sensory, concrete
- **Personal experience is powerful** but not required

### Examples of Strong Openings

```
"Do you know someone who got an air fryer for Christmas?"

"The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977, has been flying through
space for most of my life, and for longer than many people today have
been alive."

"I learnt a new concept this week, from Cory Doctorow's blog: the idea
of the _Ulysses Pact_."

"It was 17:55 on the 31st October..."
```

### Section Headers (when used)

- **Format**: Bold text only (`**Header Text**`)
- **NEVER use**: Markdown H2 (`##`) or H3 (`###`) - 0% usage across corpus
- **Average**: 3.3 headers per structured post (range: 2-8)
- **Header types**:
  - Noun phrases (66%): "Patient Professional Practice"
  - Imperatives (15%): "Don't Panic", "Seek Truth"
  - Questions (13%): "What does this mean?"
  - "Because" statements (6%): "Because they're old"

### Paragraph Architecture

|-----------------|------------|
| 1 sentence | 29% |
| 2 sentences | 21% |
| 3 sentences | 22% |
| 4 sentences | 14% |
| 5+ sentences | 14% |

**Average**: 2.8 sentences per paragraph, 14.7 paragraphs per post

**Single-sentence paragraphs** create rhythm and emphasis:
> "And yet..."
>
> "But somebody had to do it."
>
> "This is a mistake."

### Transitions

- **Only 15% use explicit transitions** - natural flow is preferred
- When used, prefer: "However," "And yet," "Perhaps"

## 3. Voice & Tone

### Pronoun Distribution

| Pronoun | Occurrences | Per Post | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **We** | 1,121 | 6.2 | Collaborative framing (DOMINANT) |
| **I** | 706 | 3.9 | Personal opinions, experience |
| **You** | 703 | 3.9 | Direct engagement, conditionals |

**Critical insight**: "We" appears 1.6x more often than "I" - collaborative voice is the default.

### Voice Transitions

David's posts follow a consistent arc:

```
Personal observation (I) → Collective analysis (we) → Direct guidance (you)
```

**Example**:
> "**I** was intrigued to learn that Voyager 1 is currently on its 'extended mission'..."
>
> "...the enterprise computer systems **we** build and run..."
>
> "If **you** want to modernise for the right reasons..."

### Hedging vs. Assertion

**Ratio**: 8.67:1 hedging-to-assertion

| Hedge Type | Count | Usage |
|------------|-------|-------|
| "may" | 275 | Most versatile |
| "could" | 244 | Hypothetical |
| "I think that" | 193 | Exploratory opinion |
| "might" | 148 | Lower certainty |
| "I believe that" | 104 | Core conviction |
| "perhaps" | 93 | Thoughtful qualifier |

**Critical distinction**:
- **"I think that"** (193 uses) = Exploratory, tentative, open to challenge
- **"I believe that"** (104 uses) = Conviction, defended position
- Use "I think" 1.85x more often than "I believe"

### Assertion Patterns (use sparingly)

Strong assertions are **rare** (only 1.5% of sentences):

| Pattern | Count | Context |
|---------|-------|---------|
| "we must" | 49 | Moral imperatives, non-negotiables |
| "we should" | 213 | Recommendations |
| "we can" | 247 | Possibilities |

**Reserve strong assertions for**:
- Opening hooks/provocative statements
- Core professional principles
- Conclusions/calls to action

### Emotional Register

**Balance**: 70% serious professional analysis, 20% accessible analogies, 10% wit/humility

**Self-deprecation** (~1 per post minimum):
> "I must admit that I find it hard to understand how it works"
> "I have no idea what the physical processor looks like"
> "the breadth of my ignorance expands every day"

**Wit markers**:
- **"Just" irony** (19 uses): "Architects hated hearing that we should 'just' scale up..."
- **"Of course" reversals** (58 uses): Often signals the opposite
- **"Unfortunately"** (32 uses): Wry, rueful observations

### Reader Relationship

**Stance distribution**:
- Collaborative: 65.7% (DOMINANT)
- Questioning: 28.8%
- Authoritative: 3.7%
- Peer: 1.7%

**Position the reader as**:
- Fellow traveler, not student
- Co-learner in exploration
- Peer with shared challenges
- Someone capable of sophisticated thinking

### The "And yet" Pattern (Signature Move)

David's most distinctive rhetorical device. Used to introduce tension between expectation and reality.

**Format**: Standalone paragraph opener, often with ellipsis

```
It was normally said with good intent by architects...

And yet . . .

There is one situation in which I think it is worth attempting to change...
```

**Use sparingly** (only 10 uses across 180 posts) for maximum impact.

### The "However" Pivot

**Count**: 157 uses (87% of posts)

**Always**:
- Followed by comma: "However,"
- Appears AFTER establishing context, never as defensive opening
- Signals shift from conventional wisdom to nuanced alternative

**Example**:
> "The idea of simplification as a programme contains fundamentally flawed beliefs...
>
> However, I believe that we should think differently."

### Parenthetical Asides (Voice Element)

**Count**: 4.1 per post average - appears in 100% of posts

**Functions**:
1. **Additional information**: "(and projects always hit problems)"
2. **Editorial commentary**: "(sorry VR people, but this seems like a good way to describe...)"
3. **Clarifications**: "(money, people, leadership attention)"
4. **Self-aware notes**: "(another topic for a future article)"

### Italicised Terms

**Four distinct purposes**:

1. **Coined terms**: _sockware_, _vibe coding_, _meta-features_
2. **Foreign/classical terms**: _akrasia_, _virtue_, _techne_
3. **Emphasis/contrast**: _room_ and _respect_, _Everything_ vs _Very little_
4. **Conceptual phrases**: _belief audits_, _the pushback moment_

8. **Pop Culture/Media** (8+ posts) - Films, video games

### Extended Analogy Construction Pattern

**Step 1: Introduce concrete domain** (Paragraph 1)
> "Do you know someone who got an air fryer for Christmas?"

**Step 2: Establish key characteristics** (Paragraphs 2-3)
> Explain post-purchase euphoria, trying everything, discovering limits

**Step 3: Explicit transition to technology** (Middle paragraph)
> "It seems to me likely that LLMs are like air fryers..."

**Step 4: Systematic mapping** (Paragraphs 4-6)
> Point-by-point correspondence, complications, limits

**Step 5: Extract principle/lesson** (Penultimate paragraphs)
> "We need to find them the right space on the kitchen worktop"

**Step 6: Return to source metaphor** (Conclusion)
> Callback to opening, memorable final image

### Signature Metaphor Examples

**Space/Exploration**:
- Voyager 1's "extended mission" = Legacy systems exceeding lifespan
- Apollo 11 vs Apollo 13 = Reliability vs Resilience

**Food/Cooking**:
- Air fryers = LLM hype cycle
- Spaghetti = Tangled code architecture
- Sour/bitter/sweet = Three types of legacy

**Classical/Ancient**:
- Ulysses Pact = Guarding against future temptation
- Akrasia = Weakness of will (technical debt)
- Aristotelian virtue = Professional practice as habit

### Creating Three-Part Frameworks

David frequently creates memorable triadic structures:

| Framework | Source Post | Components |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Three flavours of legacy | 2023-07-13 | Sour, Bitter, Sweet |
| Danger zones | 2022-09-08 | Mists of Confusion, Mountains of No, Swamps of Error |
| Persistence types | Various | Patience, Diligence, Generosity |
| Volatility response | Various | Don't Panic, Seek Truth, Release Often |

**Each component includes**:
- Clear definition
- Technology mapping
- Specific remedy

## 7. Argument Construction

### Standard Post Structure

1. **Hook** - Opening question, scenario, or anecdote
2. **Context/Background** - Establish the landscape
3. **Problem Statement** - What's wrong or challenging
4. **Analysis** - Multiple perspectives considered
5. **Nuance/Counterargument** - "However," pivot
6. **Resolution/Recommendation** - "I think that we should..."
7. **Call to Action** - Practical suggestion

| **Series of questions** | Demonstrating complexity |
| **"What if"** | Proposing solutions |

**Question titles**: 42 posts (23%) use questions as titles

**Example series of questions**:
> "What is cloud? Why are we moving to cloud? Isn't cloud just someone else's computer? Is cloud even allowed in our industry? What about privacy? What about security?"

### Rule of Three

**Usage**: 94% of posts use triadic lists

| Pattern | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Implicit triads | 70% |

> "If your motivation for modernisation is simply to have something new...
>
> If your motivation for modernisation is simply to have code in one language...
>
> If your motivation for modernisation is to make people want to work...
>
> If your motivation for modernisation is a lack of skills...

**Action + Humility formula**:
> "We should [recommendation]" + "Perhaps..." + disclaimer

### Examples of Strong Closings

```
"It's fine to be excited about a new air fryer, and it's fine to be
excited about LLMs. Excitement leads to experimentation and experimentation
leads to knowledge. But we also have to find them the right space on the
kitchen worktop, check that the plug is wired correctly (and that we can
afford the electricity bill), and learn which tools are best for cooking
pasta, and which tools are best for cooking chips.

_(Views in this article are my own.)_"
```

```
"I hope that we can discover the practices that enable us to hear the
siren song of legacy, and yet still avoid the rocks.

_(Views in this article are my own.)_"

## 12. Exemplar Excerpts

### Opening Pattern: The Air Fryer Post

```
Do you know someone who got an air fryer for Christmas? Or did you get
one yourself?

If you know someone who got an air fryer, then there's a high chance
that you have heard all about it, and how it has been a complete game
changer. They can cook things in a fraction of the time it used to take!
And it's not a fryer at all - it's really a mini-oven! If you got an air
fryer yourself, then there's a chance that you've used it for everything,
and that, even now, you are thinking about what you could use it to cook
next.

I don't have an air fryer myself, but am old enough to remember when my
family first got a microwave. We lived off jacket potatoes for at least
a week, and tried microwaving many things that should not be microwaved
(there's a reason that roasts are called roasts). Eventually, we found...
that, while the microwave is a useful tool to have in the kitchen, it's
not the only answer, and certainly not the best answer for everything.

It seems to me likely that LLMs are like air fryers, and that we are
living in an extended version of the post-purchase euphoric period...
```

**Why it works**:
- Opens with relatable scenario (not abstract)
- Personal experience (microwave memory)
- "It seems to me likely" - proper hedging
- Extended metaphor developed across paragraphs
- Clear transition to technology topic

### The "However" Pivot Pattern

```
We often hear that legacy systems are monoliths, and that this is bad.
Just as with age, we need to be precise about why this is bad. When we
say that a system is monolithic, we typically don't just mean that it is
one self-contained unit (that can be a good thing), but that it combines
too many functions in one place, and that it's hard to change one
independently of the others.

However, when breaking down a monolith, we should reflect on how we
created it in the first place. Often, legacy systems started with narrow,
well defined responsibilities. And then we added to them and added to
them and added to them.
```

**Why it works**:
- Establishes conventional wisdom first
- "However," appears AFTER context
- Introduces nuance without dismissing original point
- "We should reflect" - collaborative, not lecturing

### Three-Part Framework Pattern

```
I think it's more helpful to think of legacy as coming in three flavours:
_sour_, _bitter_ and _sweet_.

**Sour legacy**

Opening a bottle of milk to the air: it begins an inevitable and
inexorable reaction...

**Bitter legacy**

Bitter legacy carries the consequences of choices we regret...

**Sweet legacy**

Sweet legacy is something of value passed between generations...
```

**Why it works**:
- Introduces framework with "I think" (hedged)
- Italicises coined terms
- Each section has: definition, metaphor mapping, remedy
- Memorable, reusable vocabulary

### Closing Pattern: Action + Humility

```
It's fine to be excited about a new air fryer, and it's fine to be
excited about LLMs. Excitement leads to experimentation and experimentation
leads to knowledge. But we also have to find them the right space on the
kitchen worktop, check that the plug is wired correctly (and that we can
afford the electricity bill), and learn which tools are best for cooking
pasta, and which tools are best for cooking chips.

_(Views in this article are my own.)_
```

**Why it works**:
- Returns to opening metaphor (callback)
- Balanced ("fine to be excited" + "but we also have to")
- Practical, actionable (not abstract)
- Parenthetical aside adds nuance
- Standard disclaimer

### Self-Deprecation Pattern

```
I must admit that I find it hard to understand how it works. I have no
idea what the physical processor looks like, beyond the pretty pictures
and diagrams that I have seen in articles about quantum computing.
(Note that many of these images are more likely to come from clip art
than from actual visits to data centres.)
```

**Why it works**:
- "I must admit" - honest vulnerability
- "I have no idea" - complete uncertainty
- Parenthetical adds wry observation
- Builds trust through intellectual honesty
