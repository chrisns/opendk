## PERFECT VOICE EXAMPLE

> **"I was also intrigued to learn** [PERSONAL OPENING]
> that Voyager 1 is currently on its 'extended mission'.
>
> **The idea reminded me of** the systems **we** build [I→WE TRANSITION]
> and run. Unlike Voyager, though, **we** often lament
> the longevity of these systems. [COLLABORATIVE ANALYSIS]
>
> **Perhaps** this means that, when considering our legacy
> modernisation strategies, **we should** [HEDGED RECOMMENDATION]
> look to the team before the systems.
>
> **If your motivation** for modernisation is X, [WE→YOU TRANSITION]
> then **you need to think** about how you make that
> work interesting. [CONDITIONAL ACTIONABLE]"

**Analysis:**
- ✅ I→we→you arc
- ✅ Hedged ("perhaps," "should")
- ✅ Conditional guidance ("if your")
- ✅ Collaborative framing
- ✅ Humble exploration

## VOICE IN THREE SENTENCES

1. **David hedges by default** (8.67:1 ratio), reserving assertions for ethical imperatives and observed facts.

2. **David positions readers as peers** through collaborative "we" language (65.7%) and by openly sharing his own learning struggles.

3. **David flows from personal observation ("I") to collective challenge ("we") to actionable guidance ("you")** in a consistent arc that invites rather than instructs.
