But I think that, as we put these technologies to work, we must do so responsibly, and that it is urgent for us to figure out what this means. I have often claimed that professional technologists have a [duty to explain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/round-trip-question-duty-explain-david-knott/). This exercise in learning in public has convinced me that we also have a duty to _understand_: a duty to get beyond hype, excitement and opportunity, to get to grips with the basics of new technologies, and work out their implications for our companies and all the people they touch. This is especially true when those basics are hard and difficult to understand, and is a particularly important job for my favourite group of professional technologists: technology architects.

They will often show us that some things are very hard indeed - and then go on to do them anyway.",
