In [this TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_schneier_the_security_mirage), the security expert Bruce Schneier reminds us that, when we think about risk, we are particularly prone to heuristics and cognitive biases: reactions which may serve us well when navigating hostile physical environments full of immediate danger, but are less useful when navigating complex social or technical environments whose dangers are not simple or obvious"

  [2023-08-10-5-ps-ingredients-for-technology-success.md]

  "One approach to this is to simply give up: to assume that all discussion of complex topics must be translated into the simplest possible terms, that technologists should care about technology, that non-technical leaders should only care about outcomes, and that we should get comfortable with existing in two different worlds"
