## SIGNATURE PATTERNS

### Opening Hooks (Choose One)

1. **Unexpected Question**
   - "What does legacy technology taste like?"
   - "How many applications is too many? 100? 200? 1,000? 7,000?"

2. **Direct Address Question**
   - "Do you know the difference between reliability and resilience?"
   - "Are you breaking up monoliths, or creating rubble piles?"

3. **Dialogue/Scene Setting**
   - _'We've tried this before. It didn't work then. What makes this time different?'_

4. **Provocative Statement**
   - "Complexity and simplicity are friends"
   - "Programming is not typing"

### The Pivot (Essential Move)

**Formula**: [Common wisdom] → "However, I think/believe..." → [Nuanced framework]

**Examples**:
- "We usually talk as if legacy systems are unequivocally awful... However, I think that the world is not that simple."
- "Many people worry about the number of applications... However, I believe that this is a mistaken perception."

### Three-Part Development (Use Often)

**Pattern**: Bold header + 2-4 paragraphs + memorable closing line

**Example structures**:
- Problem diagnosis: "Sour, Bitter, Sweet"
- Journey obstacles: "Mists, Mountains, Swamps"
- Action principles: "Don't Panic, Seek Truth, Release Often"
- Qualities needed: "Patience, Diligence, Generosity"

### The Sympathetic Skeptic (Voice Objections)

**Formula**: Voice concern → Acknowledge legitimacy → Explain why proceeding anyway

**Example**:
```
"It might seem hard to believe that sweet legacy exists, especially
if you work in a large organisation. But it is all around us. Look
at old Open Source projects."
```

### Analogy Development (Primary Evidence)

**Formula**: Introduce early → Develop throughout → Return for closure

**Best examples**:
- Taste (sour/bitter/sweet) for legacy systems
- Geography (mists/mountains/swamps) for transformation challenges
- Space missions (Apollo 11 vs 13) for reliability vs resilience
- House guest for technology solutions

### Conclusion Formula (Use All Three)

1. **Restate framework** (often in triadic form)
2. **Measured call to action** ("we should..." + qualification)
3. **Universal disclaimer**: "_(Views in this article are my own.)_"

**Example**:
```
"In the world of technology, volatility is a feature, not a bug. There
is always more volatility to come - and always reason to avoid panic,
seek truth and release frequently.

_(Views in this article are my own.)_"
```

## TOP 10 RHETORICAL DEVICES

### 1. The Question Series
Escalating questions that build pressure toward explanation:
```
"Why does it feel as if systems go bad? Why does the cost increase with
age? Why do legacy systems seem to sour like milk?"
```

### 2. The Anaphoric Ladder
Repeated phrase at start of parallel structures:
```
"If your motivation is [X], [consequence].
If your motivation is [Y], [consequence].
If your motivation is [Z], [consequence]."
```

### 3. The However Pivot
Major turn in argument:
```
"[Common view]. However, I think that [nuanced alternative]."
```

### 4. The Three-Part Framework
Categorization that replaces binary thinking:
```
"[Concept] comes in three forms: [A], [B], and [C]."
```

### 5. The Sympathetic Objection
Voice skepticism before addressing it:
```
'We've tried this before. What makes this time different?'
[Acknowledge concern]
[Explain why this time is different]
```

### 6. The Extended Metaphor
Concrete comparison developed throughout:
```
"What does [abstract concept] taste like? → Sour → Bitter → Sweet"
```

### 7. The Humble Qualification
Soften strong claims:
```
"I am sure there are better models, but this simple framework helps
me make sense of a complex field."
```

### 8. The Not-Just-But Pattern
Escalate the claim:
```
"This is not just because [X], but because [deeper Y]."
```

### 9. The Thought Experiment
Invite reader to experience the problem:
```
"Imagine launching a programme at the beginning of 2020. You would
probably anticipate [normal challenges]. What you would not anticipate
was [extraordinary challenges]."
```

### 10. The Circular Return
End where you began:
```
Opening: "What does legacy technology taste like?"
Closing: "What does your legacy taste like?"
```
