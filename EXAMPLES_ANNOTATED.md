## EXAMPLE 1: Perfect Flowing Prose Post

**Post:** "Don't stop explaining" (2024-08-29, 879 words)

### Opening (Fact-based with question)
```
Have you ever been tempted to give up trying to explain how technology works?
To accept that 'it's not about the technology', that business people only
care about outcomes, and to keep the technical details for the people who
understand them?
```
**Analysis:**
- Opens with question (embedded in fact-based scenario, not standalone)
- Sets up the problem immediately
- Second sentence develops the first
- 2-sentence opening paragraph (common pattern)

### Body Paragraph 1 (Context via historical reference)
```
If so, it is worth referring back to a piece of wisdom buried in a footnote
of a book on computing from 1953: [long quote about explaining computing to laymen]
```
**Analysis:**
- Transitions with "If so"
- 1 long sentence (with embedded quote)
- Historical anchor - DK signature move

### Body Paragraph 2 (Single sentence for emphasis)
```
The book is _Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines_.
```
**Analysis:**
- SINGLE-SENTENCE paragraph
- Identifies the source
- Creates pause before next development

### Body Paragraph 3 (Development - 3 sentences)
```
A full online copy can be found in the Internet Archive and it is worth reading,
if only to travel back to a time when the world was beginning to get excited about
'electronic brains', but it was still possible to survey most of the computers which
existed in the world in a single volume.
```
**Analysis:**
- 1 long sentence with multiple clauses
- Parenthetical "if only to..."
- Typical DK sentence complexity

### Mid-Body Paragraphs (Mix of lengths)
```
[3 sentences - explanation of what hasn't changed]

[4 sentences - the difficulty of understanding]

[3 sentences - frustration over time]

[1 sentence - transition] ← SINGLE-SENTENCE

[3 sentences - information asymmetry]

[2 sentences - one approach to this problem]

[2 sentences - DK's position against that approach]
```
**Analysis:**
- Rhythm: 3, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2
- Single-sentence paragraph for transition
- Natural variation in length

### Closing Paragraph (Call to Action - 3 sentences)
```
We have still only just begun to explore the implications of computing, and to
put the vast and exponentially growing power of computers to work for us. If we
fail to help our non-technical colleagues grasp the implications of this power,
then the outcomes they seek will always be based on the potential of yesterday,
not that of today and tomorrow. Explaining what it means to live in a world where
'circuits exist, and can readily be built, which will perform certain specified
functions' is one of the most important things that we can do - and we should
keep on doing it.
```
**Analysis:**
- CALL TO ACTION: "we should keep on doing it"
- Callbacks to the 1953 quote
- 3 sentences building to imperative
- Typical closing length and structure

## EXAMPLE 2: Perfect Structured Post

**Post:** "Old is not bad: are you modernising legacy systems for the best reasons?" (2022-06-30, 1605 words - LONGEST POST)

### Opening (Anecdote - Voyager spacecraft, 3 paragraphs)
```
The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977, has been flying through space for
most of my life, and for longer than many people today have been alive. [continues...]

I was also intrigued to learn that Voyager 1 is currently on its 'extended mission'.
[continues...]

The idea of the extended mission immediately reminded me of the enterprise computer
systems we build and run. [continues...]
```
**Analysis:**
- Anecdote opening (time marker: 1977)
- 3 paragraphs to develop the metaphor
- Third paragraph makes the connection explicit
- Sets up entire framework

### Context Paragraph (No header yet)
```
Unlike Voyager, though, we often lament the longevity of these systems. [continues...]
```

### Context Paragraph 2 (Setup for headers)
```
These sentiments are not irrational. Legacy systems are often genuine problems
for enterprises. But this is not just because they are old: as Voyager shows us,
well built systems operating in a defined context can keep working almost
indefinitely (until the power runs out). I think that legacy transformation often
makes sense, but we do not always do it for the best reasons. Here are some
reasons often given for modernizing legacy systems, in ascending order from bad
to better.
```
**Analysis:**
- Explicit setup: "Here are some reasons..."
- Signals structure to come
- "ascending order from bad to better" - tells reader the framework

### Header 1: "Because" Pattern
```
**Because they're old**

Old <> bad. See Voyager 1.

If your motivation for modernisation is simply to have something new, remember
that it will get old too.
```
**Analysis:**
- Bold header, noun phrase ("Because X")
- First paragraph: SINGLE SENTENCE refuting
- Second paragraph: 2 sentences elaborating
- Pattern repeats for all 8 headers

### Headers 2-7 (All parallel "Because" structure)
```
**Because they're written in old coding languages**
**Because nobody wants to work on them**
**Because we don't have the skills any more**
**Because they're slow to change**
**Because operating conditions have changed**
**Because they're too big**
```
**Analysis:**
- Perfectly parallel headers
- Each followed by 2-3 paragraphs
- Earlier ones often refute; later ones validate
- Builds from weak to strong reasons

### Header 8 (Final "Because")
```
**Because somebody else does it better**

Finally, there is simply more software in the world today than when we built
those legacy systems. [continues for 3 paragraphs examining this valid reason]
```

### Closing Paragraph (Forward-looking, 2 sentences)
```
Old is not bad, but bad practices accumulated over time can make systems which
are very bad. Those bad practices may be in the way we manage software, the way
we manage people, or the way we manage architectures. The experience of running
legacy systems over decades has taught us a lot of lessons: if we don't learn
those lessons then we will build our legacy all over again. If we do learn those
lessons, then we may be able to build systems that survive extended missions far
longer than we expected.
```
**Analysis:**
- FORWARD-LOOKING close
- Callbacks to "old is not bad" and "extended missions"
- Conditional structure: if we don't... / if we do...
- Ties back to Voyager metaphor from opening

**Why This Structure Works:**
- 1605 words demands structure
- "Because" framework perfect for examining reasons
- Parallel headers create satisfying rhythm
- Opening metaphor sustained throughout
- Closing returns to metaphor

## EXAMPLE 3: Statement Opening with Italic

**Post:** "Adventures in ignorance" (2025-03-20, 877 words)

### Opening (Statement - italic)
```
_Nobody knows anything._

That's the number one rule in _Adventures in the Screen Trade_, the book by
the late screenwriter and author William Goldman (_Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid_, Marathon Man_, _All the President's Men_ and _The Princess
Bride_, amongst many others).
```
**Analysis:**
- STATEMENT opening: italic declaration
- Single sentence, set apart
- Immediate context in second paragraph
- Film industry → enterprise technology parallel coming

### Body Development (No headers, 10 paragraphs)
```
[3 sentences - Goldman's insight]
[1 sentence - transition to enterprise technology] ← SINGLE
[4 sentences - the nexus of ignorance in tech projects]
[3 sentences - Dunning-Kruger effect]
[2 sentences - even with understanding, ignorance about future]
[3 sentences - Goldman didn't give up]
[2 sentences - our tools to tackle ignorance]
[1 sentence - transition to conclusion] ← SINGLE
```
**Analysis:**
- Two single-sentence paragraphs for rhythm
- Natural flow without headers
- Builds analogy between film and tech
- Standard ~15 paragraph structure

### Closing (Call to action, callback to opening)
```
Just like in Goldman's book, we start in the dark, where nobody knows anything.
Fortunately, we don't have to stay there.
```
**Analysis:**
- CALLBACK to opening italic statement
- CALL TO ACTION: implied (use our tools, don't stay in ignorance)
- 2 sentences
- Returns to "nobody knows anything" for closure
- Optimistic pivot: "we don't have to stay there"

## EXAMPLE 4: Paragraph Rhythm Analysis

**Post:** "I like spaghetti on my plate, not in my code" (2022-09-22)

### Paragraph Breakdown (13 paragraphs total)

**Para 1 (5 sentences)** - Opening
```
If you have ever attempted to update or maintain code, you know what spaghetti
looks like. Even more, you know what it feels like. You are familiar with that
sinking feeling when you realise that, in order to make a change that should be
simple, you need to go deeper . . . and deeper . . . and deeper. [continues]
```
**Length:** 5 sentences
**Purpose:** Immersive opening that makes reader FEEL spaghetti code

**Para 2 (2 sentences)**
```
Like many things in enterprise technology, though, it's hard to explain what
spaghetti feels like to non-technical people, to make clear the impact it has
on reliability, on agility, and on the ability of teams to feel good about
their code base.
```
**Length:** 2 sentences
**Purpose:** Transitions to the communication problem

**Para 3 (3 sentences)**
```
There is an increasing number of introductory coding courses for non-technical
people. This is a very welcome development: all people working in business should
have the chance to learn at least some code. Some of them may even learn to like it.
```
**Length:** 3 sentences
**Purpose:** Acknowledges a potential solution

**Para 4 (2 sentences)**
```
But, by necessity, these courses tend to be quite short and simple: they often
teach students how to build a simple web app not far beyond 'Hello World' complexity.
This is just enough to help people appreciate the power and potential of coding, and
understand what their technical teams do. But it is not enough to convey the reality
of building complex systems from scratch, let alone the reality of maintaining code
which has grown organically over years and decades.
```
**Length:** 2 sentences (both long)
**Purpose:** "But" pivot - why solution isn't enough

**Para 5 (1 sentence)** ← SINGLE
```
Maybe there is a market opportunity here: an escape room experience which conveys
the feeling of making a small change to a legacy code base.
```
**Length:** 1 sentence
**Purpose:** Humorous aside, creates pause
**Note:** Contains parenthetical concept (escape room metaphor)

**Para 6 (1 sentence)** ← SINGLE
```
Except that you would probably need an escape building, with rooms nested within
rooms, elevators that suddenly dump you at the entrance, and empty corridors no-one
has been down for years.
```
**Length:** 1 sentence
**Purpose:** Extends the joke
**Pattern:** Two single-sentence paragraphs in a row for comic effect

**Para 7 (1 sentence)** ← SINGLE (three in a row!)
```
I'll leave that idea for someone else to develop.
```
**Length:** 1 sentence
**Purpose:** Returns to serious mode, closes digression

**Para 8 (3 sentences)**
```
(Although if you happen to be in San Jose and you want to give your business
stakeholders just a taste of what a legacy code base would look like in real
life, you could do worse than take a trip to the Winchester Mystery House: it
could provide more insight on your Silicon Valley study tour than visits to a
dozen start-ups.)
```
**Length:** 1 sentence (entire paragraph is a parenthetical!)
**Purpose:** Extended aside - classic DK move
**Note:** Entire paragraph in parentheses - rare but effective

**Para 9 (4 sentences)**
```
As is usually the case, this gap in understanding leads enterprises to behaviour
with unintended consequences. We build a system, against the clock and with many
compromises. [continues through spaghettification metaphor]
```
**Length:** 4 sentences
**Purpose:** Returns to main argument with "As is usually the case"

**Para 10 (2 sentences)**
```
And then, after much dis-satisfaction, after many failed projects and missed
deadlines, we come to realise that this legacy system is beyond saving. [continues]
```
**Length:** 2 sentences
**Purpose:** The typical response

**Para 11 (2 sentences)**
```
The spaghettification of code may seem inevitable, like the increase in entropy
prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics. Yet, like entropy, spaghettification
can be reversed - even if only locally and with a good deal of energy.
```
**Length:** 2 sentences
**Purpose:** Pivot to hope
**Note:** "Yet" transition

**Para 12 (2 sentences)**
```
That energy must come in the form of good coding practices, of a belief that code
is a valuable asset that we must care for, of a faith in the possibility of
professionalism. It must also, as ever in the world of enterprise technology, come
in the form of tireless explanation, and of making the case for not just replacing
today's spaghetti, but replacing it in a sustainable way that resists spaghettification.
```
**Length:** 2 sentences
**Purpose:** What we must do

**Para 13 (2 sentences)** - CLOSING
```
The core lesson here (and one that I have learnt painfully over the years) is
that while it may make sense to replace legacy systems that are beyond repair,
if we do not also replace the practices that put them beyond repair, we will
find ourselves in the same situation again. When we make the case for change,
we must not just make the case for changing our code, but for changing the way
we think about, value, manage and care for code. Otherwise we are just swapping
one spaghetti dish for another.
```
**Length:** 2 sentences (last one long)
**Purpose:** CALL TO ACTION close
**Note:** Parenthetical aside in first sentence; callback to spaghetti metaphor

### Rhythm Pattern Analysis

```
5 sentences  (long opening)
2 sentences
3 sentences
2 sentences  (long)
1 sentence   ← SINGLE (humor)
1 sentence   ← SINGLE (humor)
1 sentence   ← SINGLE (exit humor)
1 sentence   ← SINGLE (parenthetical aside - entire paragraph)
4 sentences  (back to main argument)
2 sentences
2 sentences
2 sentences
2 sentences  (closing)
```

**Observations:**
- 4 single-sentence paragraphs (30% - right at average)
- Three consecutive singles for humorous digression
- One entire paragraph as parenthetical
- Longer opening (5 sentences) to create immersion
- Settles into 2-sentence rhythm for closing drive
- 13 paragraphs for 899 words = 69 words/paragraph average

## EXAMPLE 5: Parenthetical Voice Analysis

**Selecting sentences from multiple posts:**

### 1. Clarifying Parenthetical
```
"We could add them, but to me they are the reason that product teams exist, and
their experience and feedback is a fundamental aspect of performance."
```
**From:** "5 Ps: Ingredients for Technology Success"
**Function:** Clarifies why users aren't explicitly shown in model

### 2. Humorous Parenthetical
```
"(Although if you happen to be in San Jose and you want to give your business
stakeholders just a taste of what a legacy code base would look like in real
life, you could do worse than take a trip to the Winchester Mystery House: it
could provide more insight on your Silicon Valley study tour than visits to a
dozen start-ups.)"
```
**From:** "I like spaghetti on my plate, not in my code"
**Function:** Extended humorous aside - entire paragraph

### 3. Meta-Commentary Parenthetical
```
"(I know: I have participated in and occasionally run such workshops)."
```
**From:** "Adventures in ignorance"
**Function:** Self-aware confession, adds credibility

### 4. Example Parenthetical
```
"Some problems are familiar from enterprise technology in any sector: how to deal
with ageing legacy systems; how to make technology platforms efficient, effective
and secure; and how to explain what we are doing to stakeholders who aren't
specialists in our field."
```
**From:** Multiple posts
**Function:** Lists examples after colon (common pattern)

### 5. The Ultimate Parenthetical
```
"_(Views in this article are my own.)_"
```
**Every post**
**Function:** Legal/professional disclaimer, signature sign-off

### 6. Qualifying Parenthetical
```
"It's often possible to replace technical skills, even in unglamorous technologies
(see above)."
```
**From:** "Old is not bad"
**Function:** Quick back-reference

### 7. Recommendation Parenthetical
```
"(For a great exploration of this topic, I highly recommend Shannon Vallor's book
Technology and the Virtues, which also considers virtue traditions beyond that
inspired by Aristotle.)"
```
**From:** "In the wonderland of new technology"
**Function:** Resource recommendation without disrupting flow

**Pattern:** Parentheticals maintain conversational flow while adding:
- Clarifications
- Examples
- Self-awareness
- Humor
- Qualifications
- Recommendations
- Meta-commentary

All without disrupting the main argument's flow.

## EXAMPLE 6: Opening + Closing Callback

**Post:** "Do you need an umbrella or a lifeboat?" (2022-07-21)

### Opening (Question embedded in fact)
```
How do you prepare for things that just keep on going wrong? And how do you
prepare for the day when everything goes wrong?

Last week I attempted to distinguish between reliability and resilience, claiming
that reliability is the ability to keep services running despite routine failures,
while resilience is the ability to restore essential services despite unexpected
catastrophes. [continues...]
```

### Three Bold Headers (Parallel Structure)
```
**Reliability protects normality; resilience strives for survival**

**Reliability should be routine; resilience requires imagination**

**Reliability needs testing; resilience requires rehearsal**
```
**Analysis:**
- Perfectly parallel construction
- Semicolon separator
- Contrasting pairs
- Beautiful example of header naming

### Key Paragraph (Introduces metaphor)
```
Reliability gives you an umbrella: a way to go about your daily business despite
the rain. Resilience gives you a lifeboat: a way to survive despite the storm.
```
**Analysis:**
- SINGLE-SENTENCE paragraph
- Introduces umbrella/lifeboat metaphor
- Colon construction for clarity

### Closing (Callback)
```
Reliability is an engineering problem; resilience is a strategic need. Both were
treated as afterthoughts in enterprise computing for many years, until we became
so dependent on computer systems that they could not be ignored. The good news is
that reliability and resilience turn out to be important, interesting and challenging
problems - as long as we remember the difference between them.
```
**Analysis:**
- Returns to reliability/resilience contrast
- Doesn't explicitly reference umbrella/lifeboat
- But title and earlier metaphor resonate
- CALLBACK close (rare - only 2.8% of posts)
- Works because opening metaphor was strong

## EXAMPLE 7: Minimal Formatting Example

**Post:** "Adventures in ignorance" (2025-03-20)

### Formatting Inventory
- **Bold:** 0 instances
- **Italic:** 2 instances (opening statement: "_Nobody knows anything._" and book title)
- **Links:** 0 instances
- **Parentheticals:** 4 instances
- **Lists:** 0 instances
- **Em-dashes:** 0 instances

### The Four Parentheticals

1. **Character introduction:**
```
"William Goldman (_Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid_, _Marathon Man_,
_All the President's Men_ and _The Princess Bride_, amongst many others)"
```

2. **Meta-commentary:**
```
"(I know: I have participated in and occasionally run such workshops)"
```

3. **Example:**
```
"(I don't understand your business? How hard can it be? I don't understand
the software development lifecycle? How hard can it be? I've never worked
with you as a client before? How different can you be from all of the
other clients?)"
```

4. **Disclaimer:**
```
"_(Views in this article are my own.)_"
```

**Analysis:**
- 877 words with almost zero formatting
- 4 parentheticals = exactly average
- Prose carries entire weight
- No bold, no lists, no structural aids
- Perfect example of DK's minimalist philosophy

---

## EXAMPLE 8: Structured Post Header Analysis

**Post:** "5 Ps: Ingredients for Technology Success" (2023-08-10, 602 words - SHORTEST)

### All Headers (Parallel Noun Phrases)
```
**Platforms**
**Products**
**People**
**Practices**
**Performance**
```

### Each Header Section (All follow same pattern)
```
**Platforms** are highly homogenous, standardised, software-defined technology
capabilities which enable products to be built at speed, with confidence that
they will scale and be reliable and secure.
```

**Analysis:**
- Perfectly parallel: "[Header] are [definition]"
- Single sentence after each header
- Then development
- Shortest post in corpus
- Headers essential because it's a framework
- Noun phrase headers (single word)
- Title explains the framework: "5 Ps"

## Key Takeaways from Examples

### Opening Patterns
1. **Fact-based** works for 75% of cases - most versatile
2. **Statement** (italic) creates immediate intrigue - 9% usage
3. **Anecdote** grounds abstract in concrete - 8% usage
4. **Embedded questions** work better than standalone

### Paragraph Rhythm
1. ~30% single-sentence is target, not maximum
2. Vary lengths: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1 creates natural flow
3. Use singles for emphasis, humor, transitions
4. Back-to-back singles can work for effect

### Headers
1. Only use when exceeding ~1000 words
2. Parallel structure is key
3. Noun phrases > other types

### Closings
1. Call to action in ~50% - most common
2. Avoid summary language
3. Callback works when opening is strong
4. 2-3 sentences typical
5. Build to imperative or insight

### Formatting
1. Less is more
2. Bold = structure only
3. Parentheticals = voice, not formatting
4. Lists = last resort
5. Let prose do the work

### Length
1. 850 words is sweet spot
2. Every post 600+ words
3. Rarely exceed 1250
4. Structure correlates with length
