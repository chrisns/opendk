      "disclaimer": "This is, of course, a personal view, based on my experience and the approach that works for me today. My practice may change as tools develop and become a more normal part of our working day. However, I think that my current experience may provide a helpful example.\n\nI am one of many people who have built a toolbox for writing and thinking that I have been using for many years. Some of these tools are ancient, constructions of grammar, style and logic which bear the marks of human history and culture. Some of these tools are much newer - for example, the way I search the Internet - but are nevertheless decades old by this point. And some of these tools arrived yesterday. They are strange and unfamiliar, and surrounded with an aura of promotion and advocacy which can seem overwhelming. Their manufacturers are keen to see what I can do with them - even though they admit that they don\u2019t know exactly what they can do, or how to use them safely. They are powerful and it would seem foolish to ignore them - but they will take some getting used to.\n\nThose of us who are in the business of deploying new technology, especially AI, should recognise that millions, if not billions, of people, will be going through this process of adjustment. We can - and should - try to help them with change management and guidance, but they will discover the best way to use these tools for themselves. And they will surprise by using this new technology in ways we never expected, just as people used programming languages, spreadsheets and the Internet in ways that were never imagined by their inventors.\n\nBut, despite the power and promise of these tools, I expect that I will continue to experience the pushback moment, and will continue to reach for a blank sheet of paper: sometimes the only person that can answer the question, \u2018What am I trying to say?\u2019 is you.\n\n_(Views in this article are my own.)_"
