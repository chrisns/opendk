# David Knott Blog Style Guide: Structure & Mechanics

**Based on analysis of 180 posts (June 2022 - December 2025)**

---

## 1. OPENING PATTERNS

### Distribution
- **FACT-BASED**: 75.0% (135 posts) - DOMINANT pattern
- **STATEMENT** (italic quote): 8.9% (16 posts)
- **ANECDOTE**: 7.8% (14 posts)
- **CONFESSION** (I-statement): 7.8% (14 posts)
- **QUESTION**: 0.6% (1 post) - RARE

### Rules

**PREFERRED: Fact-based opening (75% of posts)**
- Start with a concrete fact, scenario, or observation
- Often includes a quote that prompts reflection
- Sets up the problem/topic immediately
- Examples:
  - "The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977, has been flying through space for most of my life..."
  - "How do you prepare for things that just keep on going wrong?"
  - "'We just need to change the funding model.' I heard that phrase many times..."

**ALTERNATIVE: Statement opening (9% of posts)**
- Use italic text for opening statement or question
- Often a quote, aphorism, or provocative phrase
- Follow with immediate unpacking/context
- Format: `_Statement or question in italics_` followed by newline
- Examples:
  - "_Nobody knows anything._"
  - "_It's not fair!_"
  - "_How do you stay current?_"

**ALTERNATIVE: Anecdote opening (8% of posts)**
- Begin with time marker: "On [date]", "In [year]", "Last week", "Recently"
- Tell a specific story that illustrates the concept
- Historical or personal narrative
- Example: "On September 23rd, 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter fired its thrusters..."

**ALTERNATIVE: Confession opening (8% of posts)**
- Start with "I have...", "I am...", "I believe...", "I don't..."
- Personal admission that humanizes the topic
- Example: "I have no idea how to talk about sport."

**AVOID: Direct question opening**
- Only 1 post in 180 uses this
- Questions work better embedded in fact-based or statement openings

### First Sentence Length
- **Average**: 90 characters
- **Range**: Very wide (1-386 characters)
- **Rule**: No rigid length requirement - clarity trumps brevity
- Single-sentence paragraphs for opening are common and effective

### Second Sentence Pattern
- Immediately develop the opening hook
- Provide context, history, or personal connection
- Often longer and more explanatory than first sentence
- Sets up the "why this matters" angle

---

## 2. SECTION ORGANIZATION

### Structure Distribution
- **Flowing prose only**: 78.9% (142 posts) - DOMINANT
- **Bold headers + prose**: 21.1% (38 posts)

### Rules

**DEFAULT: Flowing prose without headers**
- Use for ~800-900 word posts
- Rely on paragraph breaks and transitions
- Let ideas flow naturally without explicit sectioning
- 4 out of 5 posts use this approach

**USE BOLD HEADERS WHEN:**
- Post exceeds 1000 words (avg 1050 vs 842 for unstructured)
- Multiple distinct points need clear delineation
- Creating a "reasons" or "types" framework (common pattern)
- Reader needs to scan/skip to specific sections

### Bold Header Specifications

**Quantity**
- Average: 3.3 headers per structured post
- Range: 2-8 headers
- Sweet spot: 3-5 headers

**Format**
- Use `**Header text**` on its own line
- NEVER use markdown headers (`##` or `###`) - 0 instances found
- Leave blank line before and after
- Capitalize first word, use natural sentence case for rest

**Naming Patterns** (125 headers analyzed)
1. **Noun phrases** (65.6%) - PREFERRED
   - "The Mists of Confusion"
   - "Motivation"
   - "People"
   - "Centrality of the Internet"

2. **Imperative statements** (15.2%)
   - "Build a habit"
   - "Respect yourself and your readers"

3. **Questions** (12.8%)
   - "How do quantum computers actually work?"
   - "Will I ever have a quantum computer in my home?"

4. **"Because" statements** (6.4%)
   - "Because they're old"
   - "Because we don't have the skills any more"
   - Special pattern for listing reasons/objections

**Common Header Patterns**
- Parallel structure for series (e.g., all "Because X" or all noun phrases)
- Contrasting pairs: "Reliability protects normality; resilience strives for survival"
- Single-word conceptual headers: "Motivation", "Ambition", "Leadership"

---

## 3. PARAGRAPH ARCHITECTURE

### Paragraph Count
- **Average**: 14.7 paragraphs per post
- **Range**: 7-37 paragraphs
- **Target**: 12-18 paragraphs for ~850-word post

### Sentences Per Paragraph Distribution
- **1 sentence**: 28.7% - VERY COMMON
- **2 sentences**: 21.0%
- **3 sentences**: 21.6%
- **4 sentences**: 13.6%
- **5+ sentences**: 14.4%

**Average**: 2.8 sentences per paragraph

### Rules

**EMBRACE SINGLE-SENTENCE PARAGRAPHS**
- Used in nearly 1/3 of all paragraphs
- Creates rhythm and emphasis
- Provides breathing room
- Often used for:
  - Transitional thoughts
  - Key insights that deserve spotlight
  - Rhetorical questions
  - Setup for next idea

**STANDARD PARAGRAPH: 2-3 sentences**
- Most common pattern (42.6% combined)
- Develop one idea clearly
- Don't over-extend

**LONGER PARAGRAPHS: 4-6 sentences**
- Use for complex ideas requiring development
- Still about 1/4 of all paragraphs
- Don't exceed 6 sentences without strong reason

**AVOID: Very long paragraphs**
- Only 1.3% have 7+ sentences
- Break up if approaching 7 sentences

### Paragraph Transitions

**Explicit transition words** (15.2% of paragraphs)
- However, but, yet, and, so, therefore
- Fortunately, unfortunately
- Of course
- First, second, third, finally

**85% use implicit transitions**
- Conceptual flow without explicit connectors
- Pronouns referring to previous concepts
- Thematic continuation
- Parallel structure

**Rule**: Don't over-rely on transition words. Let ideas flow naturally.

### Paragraph Opening Patterns

**Strong patterns observed:**
1. Pick up concept from previous paragraph
2. Ask a question to drive forward
3. Use "And" or "But" to continue/contrast (acceptable in DK style)
4. Start with concrete example or scenario
5. Time markers for narrative progression

## 4. CLOSING PATTERNS

### Disclaimer
- **Present in**: 99.4% of posts (179/180)
- **Standard format**: `_(Views in this article are my own.)_`
- **Placement**: Final line of post, after blank line

**Variants found** (4 total):
1. `_(Views in this article are my own.)_` - STANDARD
2. `(_Views in this article are my own.)_` - parentheses outside italics
3. `(Views in this article are my own.)` - no italics
4. `_(Views in this article are my own – but the horrors in your code base are yours.)_` - Halloween special

**Rule**: Always use standard format with italics inside parentheses

### Paragraph Before Disclaimer

**Call to Action** (49.4%) - MOST COMMON
- Tells reader what to do/think
- Uses "should", "must", "need to", "let's", "we can"
- Often prescriptive or inspirational
- Example: "We should be enthusiastic and evangelical. We should explain technology with patience, but we should also explain it with passion."

**Other/Reflective** (34.4%)
- Summary without explicit action
- Observation or insight
- Often more philosophical

**Forward-Looking** (12.2%)
- References future, tomorrow, ahead
- "Will", "going to" construction
- Sets up what comes next
- Example: "If we learn those lessons, then we may be able to build systems that survive extended missions far longer than we expected."

**Callback** (2.8%) - RARE but effective
- Returns to opening image/story
- Completes the circle
- Example: Reliability/resilience article returning to umbrella/lifeboat metaphor

**Synthesis** (0.6%) - VERY RARE
- Explicit "in conclusion" or "together" language
- Avoided in DK style

### Closing Architecture Rules

1. **PREFERRED**: Call to action (use ~50% of time)
   - What should reader do/think/remember?
   - Make it actionable or thought-provoking
   - Often uses "we" to include reader

2. **ALTERNATIVE**: Reflective close (use ~35% of time)
   - Insightful observation
   - Broader implication
   - Question to ponder

3. **OCCASIONAL**: Forward-looking (use ~12% of time)
   - What's next in the field
   - Future possibilities
   - Evolution of ideas

4. **SPECIAL OCCASION**: Callback (~3% of time)
   - Only when opening has strong metaphor/story
   - Must feel organic, not forced

5. **AVOID**: Explicit synthesis
   - No "in conclusion"
   - No "to summarize"
   - Let the close speak for itself

## 5. FORMATTING CONVENTIONS

### Bold (`**text**`)
- **Usage**: 186 total across 180 posts = 1.0 per post average
- **In**: 47 posts (26.1%)

## 8. RHYTHM AND PACING RULES

### Paragraph Rhythm Pattern (Most Common)

```
Longer paragraph (3-4 sentences) - sets up idea
Shorter paragraph (2 sentences) - develops
Single sentence - emphasizes key point
Medium paragraph (2-3 sentences) - elaborates
Single sentence - transitions

Repeat pattern with variations
```

### Pacing Techniques

**Speed up pacing:**
- Use more single-sentence paragraphs
- Shorter sentences
- Questions
- Lists (rare, but accelerates)

**Slow down pacing:**
- Longer paragraphs (4-5 sentences)
- More complex sentences
- Extended examples
- Detailed scenarios

**DK baseline**: Medium-to-quick pace with frequent breathing room

### Sentence Variety

While specific metrics weren't captured, observed patterns:
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones
- Avoid 3+ long sentences in a row
- Use questions to vary rhythm (but not to open)
- Single-sentence paragraphs often shorter (10-20 words)
- Multi-sentence paragraph sentences average 15-25 words

## 9. SPECIAL PATTERNS & SIGNATURES

### The Explanatory Aside (via Parentheticals)
- Present in 100% of posts
- Average 4 per post
- DK's signature voice element
- Used for:
  - Technical clarifications
  - Humorous observations
  - Meta-commentary
  - Examples
  - Acknowledgment of complexity

**Example patterns:**
- "(Although [alternative view])"
- "(I know: [confession])"
- "(For a great exploration of this topic, [recommendation])"
- "(Views in this article are my own.)" - the ultimate parenthetical

### The Rhetorical Question Pattern
- Not for opening (only 1 instance)
- Common within body paragraphs
- Often in sequences
- Used to drive reader thinking forward
- Frequently answered immediately
- Sometimes left to hang for effect

### The Contrarian Setup
- State conventional wisdom or common complaint
- Acknowledge its validity
- Then pivot: "However...", "But...", "Yet..."
- Offer nuanced or alternative view
- Common in ~40% of posts

### The Narrative Time Travel
- Start present → flash to past → return to present
- Or: historical example → modern parallel
- Voyager spacecraft = legacy systems
- Mars Climate Orbiter = communication failures
- Historical figures → modern technologists

### The Recursive Callback
- Reference earlier posts with links
- "As I wrote last week..."
- "In my previous article..."
- Creates sense of ongoing conversation
- More common in series (quantum computing, AI)
