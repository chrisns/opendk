## EXAMPLE 1: "The Three Flavours of Legacy" (2023)

### COMPLETE STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN

#### Opening (Question Hook + Context)
```
What does legacy technology taste like?

That might seem like an odd question, not just because it's strange to
ask about the taste of technology, but also because it might seem obvious
that legacy tastes bad. We usually talk as if legacy systems are
unequivocally awful. We have legacy remediation programmes, legacy
reduction programmes, and legacy elimination programmes.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Unexpected question (taste metaphor)
- ✓ Acknowledges it seems odd (pre-empts objection)
- ✓ States conventional wisdom (sets up for pivot)
- ✓ Concrete examples (programs we actually run)

---

#### The Pivot (However → Framework Introduction)
```
However, I think that the world is not that simple, and that it's more
helpful to think of legacy systems as coming in three flavours: sour,
bitter and sweet.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ "However" signals major pivot
- ✓ "I think" = humble expert voice
- ✓ "not that simple" = classic DK phrase
- ✓ Introduces three-part framework
- ✓ Returns to taste metaphor from opening

---

#### Section 1: Sour Legacy (Pattern Development)
```
**Sour Legacy**

Legacy is sour when it has gone off over time.

This does not have to be the case. Despite our talk about ageing technology,
and horror at the idea of systems that were built twenty or even thirty years
ago, old does not necessarily mean bad in the world of technology. Well-written
software will keep on doing its job, as long as that job stays the same and it
has a stable environment to run in.

Why, then, does it feel as if systems go bad? Why does the cost and risk of
legacy systems seem to increase with age? Why do legacy systems seem to sour
like milk?

[3 more paragraphs explaining infrastructure decay, vulnerability exposure]

The only remedy to stop our legacy systems going sour at the infrastructure
level is continuous refresh. [Develops metaphor: new milk every day = ephemeral
infrastructure]

We can avoid sourness by keeping things fresh.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Bold header for section
- ✓ Simple definition: "when it has gone off"
- ✓ Immediately counters with "but" (This does not have to be the case)
- ✓ Question series building pressure (Why? Why? Why?)
- ✓ Returns to milk/sour metaphor
- ✓ Explains mechanism (vulnerabilities + time)
- ✓ Provides remedy
- ✓ Memorable closing line (parallel to section header)

---

#### Section 2: Bitter Legacy (Parallel Structure)
```
**Bitter Legacy**

Legacy is bitter when it carries the consequences of choices we regret.

Once again, old does not mean bad, and working software will not only go on
working indefinitely, but will also always be infinitely malleable. All we
have to do is change it.

Why then, are older systems so hard to change? [Question series repeats pattern]

[Development of code quality debt]

That is why this form of legacy tastes bitter. Sour legacy, where infrastructure
drifts out of date and becomes vulnerable or unsupported, is a function of the
nature of commercial products and the people who want to attack those products.
Bitter legacy is a function of our choices.

The only remedy to legacy systems becoming bitter at the application layer is
to give priority to readability and maintainability throughout the entire
product lifecycle.

We can avoid bitterness if we care about code quality and act accordingly.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Parallel structure to Section 1
- ✓ "Once again" signals continuity
- ✓ Repeats question pattern (Why then...? Why...?)
- ✓ Contrasts with previous section ("Sour legacy... Bitter legacy...")
- ✓ Remedy matches pattern
- ✓ Closing line parallels Section 1

---

#### Section 3: Sweet Legacy (Positive Alternative)
```
**Sweet Legacy**

Legacy is sweet when we have well-maintained, well-run functional code which
we understand well and which continues to do its job. It is the proof that old
does not have to equal bad, and it lives up to the normal meaning of the term
'legacy' in the language: something of value passed between generations.

It might seem hard to believe that sweet legacy exists, especially if you work
in a large organisation. But it is all around us. Look at old Open Source
projects. Linux was released in 1994, and it is everywhere today.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Parallel structure maintained
- ✓ Positive definition (contrasts with previous two)
- ✓ Anticipates objection ("It might seem hard to believe")
- ✓ Concrete example (Linux)
- ✓ References Ship of Theseus (philosophical depth)

---

#### Synthesis/Conclusion (Recap + Return)
```
To recap: sour legacy is when technology goes bad at the infrastructure layer,
increasing the risk of failure or compromise, and is best addressed through
continuous refresh and ephemeral, software-defined infrastructure; bitter legacy
is when we degrade the quality of software at the application layer, increasing
the cost and effort of change, and is best addressed by paying attention to code
quality and creating time for refactoring; and sweet legacy is when we build
things well and look after them, creating robust, secure, flexible solutions
which stand the test of time.

What does your legacy taste like?

## EXAMPLE 2: "Danger Zones on the Way to Cloud" (2022)

### COMPLETE STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN

#### Opening (Dialogue Hook + Scene Setting)
```
'We've tried this before. It didn't work then. What makes this time different?'

Are there any more dispiriting words to hear when you're leading transformation?
If you've been in that job, the scene is familiar. You have built the business
case. You have secured the investment for the programme. You have found your
partners. You have prepared your slides and you have organised the launch
meeting. You are ready to inspire, organise and motivate. You have delivered
your pitch and you have opened the floor for questions.

The first hand that goes up is from a veteran member of the team. They have
lived through many changes. They know the systems inside out. Their support is
vital: other people will follow their lead. And then they ask that dreaded
question.

'We've tried this before. It didn't work then. What makes this time different?'

[Scene continues with skeptical follow-up six months later]
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Dialogue hook (italicized question)
- ✓ "Are there any more dispiriting words" = empathy
- ✓ "If you've been in that job" = direct address
- ✓ Anaphora: "You have... You have... You have..."
- ✓ Scene-setting makes abstract concrete
- ✓ Repeats opening question (emphasis through repetition)
- ✓ Adds time progression (six months later)

---

#### Problem Statement + Pivot
```
Transformation is difficult and the temptation to give up is constant. For some
people, such as the questioner in the scene above, it's there from the beginning.
I believe that one of the biggest and most common mistakes in transformation is
to give up part way through, to leave the journey half completed.

This is the fourth in a series of articles... This article is about persistence.

The journey from a legacy, on-premise architecture to cloud is difficult,
especially when you realise that you're not just moving technical assets such
as applications, servers and datasets: you are moving your teams and the way
they work. Let's consider three steps along that journey that present particular
challenges, make the prospect of giving up ever more tempting, and require
persistence to get through.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ "I believe" = humble expert
- ✓ States core argument (don't give up)
- ✓ Meta-reference to series (builds continuity)
- ✓ "This article is about [X]" = clear signposting
- ✓ "Let's consider three..." = invites reader collaboration
- ✓ Rule of Three announced

---

#### Section 1: The Mists of Confusion
```
**The Mists of Confusion**

You will be shrouded in the mists of confusion at the beginning of your journey.

What is cloud? Why are we moving to cloud? Isn't cloud just someone else's
computer? Is cloud even allowed in our industry? What about privacy? What about
security? What about regulation?

All of these questions are legitimate and, as ever, we shouldn't blame people
for not knowing the answers. At the beginning of the journey, our job is to
explain, patiently and carefully, in language that everybody understands, until
the mists start to lift and we can see the path ahead.

[Development continues]

In this case, persistence requires patience.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Alliterative metaphor ("Mists of Confusion")
- ✓ Direct address ("You will be")
- ✓ Question barrage (7 questions rapid-fire)
- ✓ Validates questions ("legitimate")
- ✓ "as ever" = pattern recognition
- ✓ Extends metaphor ("mists start to lift")
- ✓ Formula closing: "In this case, [virtue] requires [quality]"

---

#### Section 2: The Mountains of No (Parallel Pattern)
```
**The Mountains of No**

Encountering the same questions over and over again can be frustrating, but it
can sometimes be worse to encounter answers, especially when those answers always
seem to be, 'No'. The Mountains of No are made of all those policies and
procedures which tell you that cloud is simply not allowed.

[Development of obstacle]

The key to scaling the Mountains of No is to know your ground and look for
footholds.

[Explanation of approach]

In this case, persistence requires diligence.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Links to previous section ("Encountering the same questions")
- ✓ "but it can sometimes be worse" = escalation
- ✓ Continues journey metaphor ("scaling")
- ✓ Concrete guidance ("know your ground and look for footholds")
- ✓ Parallel closing formula

---

#### Section 3: The Swamps of Error (Completes Pattern)
```
**The Swamps of Error**

You will make mistakes on your journey to cloud. Somebody will misconfigure
permissions for an asset, and expose it to potential unauthorized access.
Somebody will make deployment choices which expose a critical system to a
zone level failure. [Concrete examples continue]

The question is not whether you or someone else will fall into one or more of
these patches of swampy ground, it's what you do when they do. You can respond
with blame and dismay, asking the person who is steadily sinking into the ground
to explain why they were so stupid, before retreating in disarray. Or you can
remain calm, help them back onto solid ground, figure out what you learnt,
adjust your map, lay boards and bridges, and proceed on your way.

In this case, persistence requires generosity.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ "You will make mistakes" = acceptance of reality
- ✓ "Somebody will..." anaphora (3 times)
- ✓ "The question is not... it's..." = reframing
- ✓ Binary choice presented (blame vs. help)
- ✓ Extends swamp metaphor ("sinking," "solid ground," "boards and bridges")
- ✓ Completes triadic closing formula

---

#### Synthesis (Return to Opening)
```
These are not the only danger zones that you will encounter in your journey to
cloud: if you are part way on your journey, I am sure that you can think of
many more.

Rather than exploring those, though, let's return to the question at the start
of this article.

'We've tried this before. It didn't work then. What makes this time different?'

Cloud is not new any more. Many companies are on their second or third attempt
at cloud transformation. Or they are part way through their first and wondering
why it is so hard. What do you say in response to this question? If you've
mastered the three types of persistence outlined in this article, then you can
remind the questioner patiently about the reasons for the transformation and why
you believe it can work, you can show how policies and procedural obstacles are
steadily and diligently being overcome, and you can explain how even errors,
approached with generosity, are pushing the transformation forward. And, at root,
you can say that this time it's going to be different because we're not going to
give up: we're going to persist.

_(Views in this article are my own.)_
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Acknowledges limitations ("not the only danger zones")
- ✓ "I am sure you can think of many more" = humility
- ✓ "let's return to the question" = explicit circular structure
- ✓ Repeats opening dialogue (italicized)
- ✓ Now answerable with framework: patience, diligence, generosity
- ✓ Long synthesis sentence weaving all three together
- ✓ "And, at root" = gets to essence
- ✓ Ends with the core concept: persist
- ✓ Disclaimer

### KEY PATTERNS USED
1. Dialogue hook (voiced objection) ✓
2. Scene-setting (make abstract concrete) ✓
3. Three-part framework with alliterative names ✓
4. Journey/geography metaphor throughout ✓
5. Parallel section structures ✓
6. "In this case, X requires Y" formula ✓
7. Question series to dramatize confusion ✓
8. Circular return to opening ✓
9. Now-answerable question (framework payoff) ✓
10. Disclaimer ✓

## EXAMPLE 3: "Complexity and Simplicity Are Friends" (2024)

### COMPLETE STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN

#### Opening (Escalating Question + Pattern Recognition)
```
How many applications is too many? 100? 200? 1,000? 7,000?

I have worked for many different organisations with different numbers of
applications. Whatever the numbers, though, they all had one thing in common:
somebody, somewhere thought that we had too many applications.

I have always found this belief puzzling. We build applications because we
believe that they have value (otherwise we wouldn't put so much effort into
writing those business cases). We celebrate our success when we implement them.
And then we record their existence in our great big list of applications, lament
that we have so many, and wish that we had fewer. Is there any other field of
endeavour where what we have built moves so quickly from asset to liability
(whatever our accounting rules say)?
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Escalating numbers question (builds absurdity)
- ✓ Personal experience: "I have worked for many..."
- ✓ Pattern recognition: "they all had one thing in common"
- ✓ "I have always found this puzzling" = sets up investigation
- ✓ Paradox highlighted (celebrate → lament)
- ✓ Rhetorical question at end of paragraph

---

#### Problem Diagnosis
```
I believe that people worry about the number of applications in their estate
because of an inherent fear of complexity, and because the number of applications
is a visible signal of complexity. They perceive that their technology is
becoming too costly, too slow and too risky, and they also see that these factors
rise in sync with the number of applications. The more stuff they have, the
harder it seems to get.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ "I believe" = humble expert
- ✓ Diagnosis of root cause (fear of complexity)
- ✓ Tricolon: "too costly, too slow and too risky"
- ✓ Simple closing: "The more stuff... the harder it seems"

---

#### The Pivot (However → Counterintuitive Claim)
```
I believe that this is a mistaken perception. Complexity, whether expressed
through number of applications or some other metric, does not have to correlate
with increased cost, friction and risk. Sometimes it does, but that is because
we often design, build and run technology badly. And, despite the vast quantities
of badly run technology in the world, running technology badly is not mandatory:
when we run it well, complexity is manageable. It may even be an advantage.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ "I believe that this is a mistaken perception" = DK signature
- ✓ "does not have to" = nuance (not absolute)
- ✓ "Sometimes it does, but..." = acknowledges then qualifies
- ✓ Parenthetical humor ("despite the vast quantities of badly run technology")
- ✓ "It may even be an advantage" = escalates the claim

---

#### Framework Setup (Distinction Introduction)
```
Last week, I argued for the value of simple ideas, explained well. It might seem
that, this week, I am arguing for the opposite. However, I believe that complexity
and simplicity are compatible: indeed, I believe that simplicity is essential for
managing complexity. To see this, let's look at the difference between two
strategies for dealing with growing technology estates: simplification and
simplicity.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Links to previous post (continuity)
- ✓ Anticipates objection ("It might seem... I am arguing for the opposite")
- ✓ "However, I believe" = pivot phrase
- ✓ Paradoxical claim (title payoff: "complexity and simplicity are friends")
- ✓ "To see this, let's look at" = invitation
- ✓ Sets up two-part contrast (simplification vs. simplicity)

---

#### Section 1: Simplification (The Wrong Approach)
```
Simplification is a strategy pursued by many large enterprises, typically those
with large application estates. The idea is straightforward: we have too much
stuff; we should have less stuff; let's identify the stuff we don't need and
get rid of it. [Development continues]

Unfortunately, execution is rarely straightforward. [Explains problems]

The idea of simplification as a programme contains fundamentally flawed beliefs:
that complexity is avoidable; that it is possible and desirable to have a
technology architecture which only consists of a few components; and that the
net trend in number of systems needed to run a business is downwards. Everything
we have experienced in the digitisation of organisations over the last several
decades tells us that these beliefs are wrong.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Italicized term for emphasis
- ✓ "The idea is straightforward" then "execution is rarely straightforward" = ironic parallel
- ✓ Tricolon of flawed beliefs (semicolon-separated)
- ✓ Appeals to experience ("Everything we have experienced")
- ✓ Clear judgment: "these beliefs are wrong"

---

#### Section 2: Simplicity (The Right Approach)
```
Simplicity is a less commonly pursued strategy, or at least a strategy which is
less frequently made explicit. [Develops contrast]

The idea is more subtle: complexity is inevitable; we will always have more
components; we do not know ahead of time exactly how our components will be used;
we will design them with well defined interfaces and behaviour so that they can
survive in unknown contexts. We will measure our success through ease of use,
reliability and speed, and we will pursue this strategy as a practice (not a
programme).

Executing this strategy is also rarely straightforward. It requires the
persistence and determination to build sustainable components, optimised for long
term value and use, in the face of pressure to optimise for short term feature
and function. However, the benefits of this strategy are profound and proven. It
also has the advantage that it reflects reality: the inherent complexity of
computing; the value of architectures containing multiple components; and the net
trend towards building more systems to do more work.
```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Parallel structure to Section 1 (but positive)
- ✓ "more subtle" vs. "straightforward" (elevates this approach)
- ✓ Semicolon-separated principles (mirrors Section 1's structure)
- ✓ "(not a programme)" = explicit contrast
- ✓ "Executing this strategy is also rarely straightforward" = honest about difficulty
- ✓ "However, the benefits" = pivot within section
- ✓ "profound and proven" = alliteration
- ✓ Tricolon of realities (mirrors Section 1's tricolon)

---

#### Conclusion (Call to Action + Humility)
```
Currently, business sponsors are more likely to back simplification programmes
than the practice of simplicity. I do not blame them for this. They are
responding to what they can see, and those of us in the technology field have
not done a good job of explaining that they can only see part of the picture.
If we work harder, I believe that we can show that complexity and simplicity
are compatible.

```

**RHETORICAL MOVES**:
- ✓ Describes current reality
- ✓ "I do not blame them" = generous to sponsors
- ✓ "we have not done a good job" = takes responsibility
- ✓ "If we work harder, I believe" = conditional optimism
- ✓ Returns to title claim (circular structure)
- ✓ Disclaimer

## CROSS-CUTTING PATTERNS ACROSS ALL THREE EXAMPLES

### Universal Elements
1. **Disclaimer**: Every post ends with "_(Views in this article are my own.)_"
2. **"I believe"**: Appears 2-4 times per post (humble expert voice)
3. **"However"**: 1-3 major pivots per post
4. **Rule of Three**: All three use triadic structures
5. **Questions**: All open with questions (various types)

### Consistent Flow
```
1. Hook (question/dialogue/scene)
   ↓
2. Context (why this matters)
   ↓
3. Conventional wisdom (what people think now)
   ↓
4. Pivot ("However, I think/believe...")
   ↓
5. Framework (usually 3 parts)
   ↓
6. Development (parallel sections)
   ↓
7. Synthesis (recap all elements)
   ↓
8. Call to action (measured, qualified)
   ↓
9. Disclaimer
```

### Voice Consistency
- **Tone**: Patient, persistent, optimistic but realistic
- **Stance**: Humble expert who has "seen" patterns
- **Relationship with reader**: Collaborative ("let's," "we should")
- **Treatment of opposition**: Sympathetic, never dismissive

### Metaphor Strategy
- **Example 1**: Taste (sour/bitter/sweet) - sensory
- **Example 2**: Geography (mists/mountains/swamps) - journey
- **Example 3**: No extended metaphor - contrast structure instead

**Takeaway**: Extended metaphor is common but not mandatory. When present, it provides cohesion. When absent, strong structure compensates.
