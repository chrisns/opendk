## MOST IMPORTANT PATTERNS

If you remember only FIVE things from this entire analysis:

### 3. The Rule of Three
Organize major content in three parallel sections
- Sour, Bitter, Sweet
- Patience, Diligence, Generosity
- Don't Panic, Seek Truth, Release Often

### 4. The Analogy Through-Line
Introduce metaphor early, develop throughout, return to in conclusion
- Taste for legacy types
- Journey/geography for transformation obstacles
- House guest for technology behavior

### 5. Action + Humility + Disclaimer
End with qualified optimism and universal disclaimer
- "We should [action]... If we [condition], we can [outcome]."
- "I am sure there are better approaches, but..."
- "_(Views in this article are my own.)_"

## FINAL THOUGHTS

### What Makes David's Arguments Work

1. **Nuance over simplicity**: Refuses binary thinking
