## 2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

### Core Recurring Frameworks:

**"Duty to Understand" / "Duty to Explain"** (13+ posts)
- The central organizing principle of David's professional ethics
- Technologists have a **professional responsibility** to understand technology deeply
- They have an equal responsibility to **explain technology** to non-technical stakeholders
- Not optional - it's a duty, especially for architects and senior technologists
- Key posts:
  - "Generative AI and the duty to understand" (2023-01-05)
  - "Conway's law: power, money, capability and the duty to explain" (2022-11-17)
  - "Don't stop explaining" (2024-08-29)

**Extended Mission Concept** (Voyager 1 metaphor)
- Systems built for 3-5 years live for 20-30+ years
- Just like Voyager 1's "extended mission" beyond its original goals
- Legacy isn't failure - it's success lasting longer than expected
- Organizations must plan for extended missions from the start
- Key post: "Old is not bad: are you modernising legacy systems for the best reasons?" (2022-06-30)

**"Room and Respect"** for teams
- Legacy teams need autonomy ("room") and recognition ("respect")
- They're not stuck in the past - they're maintaining critical systems
- Given freedom, these teams often know exactly what needs fixing
- Key post: "Give your legacy teams room and respect" (2023-10-05)

**"Both/And" thinking vs. "Either/Or"**
- Complexity and simplicity are friends
- Innovation AND application both matter
- Old AND new technologies coexist
- Technical AND human factors both critical
- Resists false dichotomies

**Professional Responsibility Framing**
- Technology work is not just a job - it transforms lives
- Technologists have power; power requires responsibility
- Public service context frequently invoked
- Echoes of civic duty and social impact
