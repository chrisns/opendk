# David Knott's Rhetorical & Argument Patterns Style Guide

**Analysis of 180 blog posts (June 2022 - December 2025)**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

David's argumentation is **measured, nuanced, and persistently optimistic**. He builds arguments through:
- **Questions as hooks** (4.09 questions/post average, 42 posts with question titles)
- **Triadic structures** (94% of posts use three-part lists)
- **Strategic counterarguments** (157 "However" pivots, 487 "but" qualifications)
- **Personal + analogical evidence** (119 analogies, 63 personal experiences)
- **Action-oriented yet humble conclusions** (74% action-oriented, 82% with humility markers)

His signature move: **acknowledge complexity, provide nuance, resist panic, call to measured action**.

---

## 1. QUESTION USAGE

### Statistics
- **Total questions across 180 posts**: 736
- **Average per post**: 4.09 questions
- **Posts with question titles**: 42 (23%)
- **Pattern**: Questions decrease as post progresses (front-loaded interrogation)

### Question Types

#### A. Title Questions (Opening Hooks)
**Purpose**: Frame the entire argument as an inquiry, inviting reader collaboration

**Examples**:
```
"Do you know the difference between reliability and resilience?"
"Do you need an umbrella or a lifeboat?"
"Is your technology solution a well behaved house guest?"
"What if we behaved as if we cared about technology?"
"Are you breaking up monoliths, or creating rubble piles?"
"How do we get what we want from AI systems - and human systems?"
```

**Pattern**:
- Direct address ("Do you...", "Are you...", "Is your...")
- Binary choices ("X or Y?")
- Collective challenge ("How do we...", "What if we...")

#### B. Opening Paragraph Questions
**Purpose**: Immediate engagement, sets up the problem to be explored

**Example from "Three Flavours of Legacy"**:
```
"What does legacy technology taste like?"

[Develops the unexpected metaphor]
```

**Example from "Complexity and Simplicity Are Friends"**:
```
"How many applications is too many? 100? 200? 1,000? 7,000?"

[Uses escalating numbers to dramatize the question]
```

#### C. Rhetorical Question Series (Building Argument)
**Purpose**: Lead reader through logical progression, anticipate objections

**Example from "Danger Zones on the Way to Cloud"**:
```
"What is cloud? Why are we moving to cloud? Isn't cloud just someone
else's computer? Is cloud even allowed in our industry? What about privacy?
What about security? What about regulation?"
```

**Pattern**: Staccato rhythm, each question slightly more specific, ending with the hardest questions

**Example from "Three Flavours of Legacy"**:
```
"Why, then, does it feel as if systems go bad? Why does the cost and risk
of legacy systems seem to increase with age? Why do legacy systems seem to
sour like milk?"
```

**Pattern**: Repeated "Why" creates mounting pressure, drives toward explanation

#### D. Dialogic Questions (Imagined Objections)
**Purpose**: Voice skepticism, then address it

**Example from "Danger Zones on the Way to Cloud"**:
```
'We've tried this before. It didn't work then. What makes this time different?'

[Full paragraph exploring this voiced concern]

Six months later...

'We knew this wasn't going to work. How much more effort are we going to
put into it before we call it quits?'
```

**Pattern**: Italicized dialogue questions followed by sympathetic response

### Question Templates

**For opening hooks**:
- "What does [abstract concept] [unexpected verb]?"
- "How many [X] is too many?"
- "Do you [common action] or [alternative action]?"

**For building argument**:
- "Why, then, [restate problem]? Why [deeper problem]? Why [deepest problem]?"
- "[Question 1]? [Question 2]? [Question 3]? [Most difficult question]?"

**For addressing skepticism**:
- Voice the objection in italics or quotes
- Acknowledge its legitimacy
- Explain why it's worth addressing anyway

## 2. RULE OF THREE

### Statistics
- **Posts with "First, Second, Third" structure**: 43 (24%)
- **Posts with triadic lists**: 170 (94%)
- **Typical pattern**: One major three-part structure per post

### Three-Part Structures

#### A. Explicit Numbered Lists

**Example from "5 Ps: Ingredients for Technology Success"**:
```
Platforms
Products
People
Practices
Performance
```
*(Note: Five here, but still follows principle of enumeration)*

**Example from "Coping with Volatility"**:
```
Don't Panic
Seek Truth
Release Often
```

**Pattern**: Bold headers, parallel structure, imperative mood

**Example from "Five Pieces of Advice for Technical Leaders"**:
```
Don't panic
Hire people smarter than you
Embrace your ignorance
Choose to lead
Advocate for technologists
```

**Structure**:
- Action-oriented imperatives
- Each section develops metaphor or explanation
- Symmetrical length (roughly 2-3 paragraphs each)

#### B. Triadic Lists (Without Numbering)

**Example from "The Three Flavours of Legacy"**:
```
Title: "The three flavours of legacy: sour, bitter and sweet"

Structure:
- Sour Legacy (infrastructure decay)
- Bitter Legacy (code quality debt)
- Sweet Legacy (well-maintained systems)

Summary paragraph restates all three:
"_sour_ legacy is when technology goes bad at the infrastructure layer...
_bitter_ legacy is when we degrade the quality of software at the
application layer... and _sweet_ legacy is when we build things well..."
```

**Pattern**:
- Memorable metaphor (taste)
- Symmetrical development
- Recap that restates all three

#### C. Embedded Triads (Within Sentences)

**From analysis data**:
```
"of agility, inflated costs, and alarming risk"
"drag, friction, and waste"
"enthusiasts, advocates, and detractors"

"to inspire, organise, and motivate"
"applications, servers, and datasets"

"polite, discrete, and reliable"
"see me, hear me, and talk to me"

"empowerment, balance, and persistence"
```

**Pattern**:
- Three qualities/attributes/entities
- Usually ascending in intensity or specificity
- Often alliterative or rhythmically balanced

#### D. Three Danger Zones Pattern

**Example from "Danger Zones on the Way to Cloud"**:
```
The Mists of Confusion
The Mountains of No
The Swamps of Error

Each requires different persistence:
- Mists require patience
- Mountains require diligence
- Swamps require generosity
```

**Pattern**:
- Alliterative or metaphorical names
- Symmetrical structure
- Each has specific remedy/lesson

### Templates for Rule of Three

**Major structure**:
```
[Bold Header 1]
[2-4 paragraphs developing concept]

[Bold Header 2]
[2-4 paragraphs developing concept]

[Bold Header 3]
[2-4 paragraphs developing concept]

[Summary paragraph restating all three]
```

**Within-sentence triads**:
- "[Quality], [Quality], and [Quality]"
- "[Action], [Action], and [Action]"
- Prefer: building intensity, parallel grammar, rhythmic balance

**Closing recap**:
```
"To recap: [concept 1] is when [X]... [concept 2] is when [Y]...
and [concept 3] is when [Z]."
```

---

## 3. COUNTERARGUMENT PATTERNS

### Statistics
- **"However" pivots**: 157 instances (87% of posts)
- **"But" qualifications**: 487 instances (all posts, multiple uses)
- **"And yet" tensions**: 25 instances (14% of posts)
- **Pattern**: Counterarguments appear AFTER establishing position, not before

### Pivot Words & Their Functions

#### A. "However" - Major Pivot Point
**Function**: Introduce significant qualification or alternative perspective

**Examples**:

```
"However, I think that the world is not that simple, and that it's more
helpful to think of legacy systems as coming in three flavours: sour,
bitter and sweet."
```
*[Pivots from conventional wisdom to nuanced framework]*

```
"However, I also believe that we need to do more than just take the time
to explain: I think that we need to change the way we express our attitudes
towards technology."
```
*[Escalates from explanation to action]*

```
"However, this did not mean that the cloud business case was a bust: rather,
the benefits came from the productivity of DevOps teams."
```
*[Redirects from apparent failure to actual success]*

**Pattern for "However"**:
- Usually starts new paragraph
- Signals shift in argument direction
- Often followed by "I think" or "I believe"
- Introduces the more nuanced/sophisticated view

#### B. "But" - Qualification & Complexity
**Function**: Add complexity without fully pivoting

**Examples**:

```
"I think that legacy transformation often makes sense, but we do not always
do it for the best reasons."
```
*[Acknowledges value while critiquing execution]*

```
"All those things are important (it's hard to organise lots of people to do
complicated things, and hard to get them to stay organised), but they are
necessary rather than sufficient."
```
*[Validates before introducing higher standard]*

```
"This is not just because it defers some of the primary benefits of cloud,
but because it defers the completion of the very foundations and controls
we are trying to build."
```
*[Escalates the critique - "not just X, but Y"]*

**Pattern for "But"**:
- Can appear mid-sentence or start sentence
- Creates two-part structure: acknowledgment + qualification
- Often paired with "not just... but..."
- Maintains forward momentum while adding nuance

#### C. "And yet" - Paradox & Tension
**Function**: Highlight contradiction that drives argument

**Examples**:

```
"And yet software keeps going on much longer than this."
```
*[Points to gap between expectation and reality]*

```
"Have you ever attempted a transformation programme where you set up all
the necessary mechanics, and yet the programme failed to fire?"
```
*[Emphasizes puzzling outcome despite effort]*

```
"And yet many enterprises still seem reluctant to move into their new home."
```
*[Highlights irrational behavior despite clear benefits]*

**Pattern for "And yet"**:
- Creates dramatic tension
- Usually references contradiction between theory/expectation and practice
- Signals a puzzle that needs explaining
- Less frequent but higher impact than "but"

### Counterargument Positioning

#### Strategy 1: Acknowledge-Pivot-Develop
```
[State common view or practice]
↓
However/But [introduce qualification]
↓
[Develop alternative view with evidence]
```

**Example**:
```
"We usually talk as if legacy systems are unequivocally awful. We have
legacy remediation programmes, legacy reduction programmes, and legacy
elimination programmes.

However, I think that the world is not that simple, and that it's more
helpful to think of legacy systems as coming in three flavours."
```

#### Strategy 2: Build-Up-Then-Complicate
```
[Establish strong position]
[Provide 2-3 supporting points]
↓
But/However [add crucial nuance]
↓
[Explain why nuance matters]
```

**Example from "Complexity and Simplicity Are Friends"**:
```
"I believe that this is a mistaken perception. Complexity, whether expressed
through number of applications or some other metric, does not have to
correlate with increased cost, friction and risk.

[Several paragraphs developing this view]

However, I believe that complexity and simplicity are compatible: indeed,
I believe that simplicity is essential for managing complexity."
```

#### Strategy 3: Anticipate-and-Address
```
[Imagine objection]
↓
[Acknowledge legitimacy]
↓
But/However [explain why proceeding anyway]
```

**Example**:
```
"It might seem hard to believe that sweet legacy exists, especially if you
work in a large organisation. But it is all around us. Look at old Open
Source projects."
```

### Templates for Counterarguments

**Major pivot**:
```
"However, I think/believe that [more nuanced view]."
"However, this does not mean [misconception]; rather, [actual implication]."
```

**Qualification**:
```
"[Statement is true], but [important caveat]."
"This is not just because [obvious reason], but because [deeper reason]."
```

**Paradox**:
```
"And yet [observation that contradicts expectation]."
```

**Acknowledge-then-challenge**:
```
"I can understand why [people think X]. But I believe [alternative Y]."
```

## 4. EVIDENCE INTEGRATION

### Statistics
- **Personal experience markers**: 63 instances
- **External references**: 105 instances
- **Analogies**: 119 instances
- **Data/statistics**: Very rare (appears in <5% of posts)

### Evidence Types

#### A. Personal Experience
**Function**: Establish credibility, ground abstract concepts in reality

**Markers**:
- "In my career/experience..."
- "I have seen/found/noticed..."
- "I've worked for many different organisations..."
- "When I..."

**Examples**:

```
"I have seen this done, I have seen two important results."
```

```
"I have found that new computing topics can be divided into two broad
categories."
```

```
"I have worked for many different organisations with different numbers of
applications. Whatever the numbers, though, they all had one thing in
common: somebody, somewhere thought that we had too many applications."
```

**Pattern**:
- Brief, not detailed war stories
- Used to establish pattern, not to brag
- Often leads to generalization: "I have seen X" → "This suggests Y"
- Humble tone: focuses on learning, not achievement

#### B. Analogies (Primary Evidence Type)
**Function**: Make abstract technical concepts concrete and memorable

**High-Impact Analogies**:

**1. Food/Taste Metaphor**:
```
"What does legacy technology taste like?"

Sour: "Systems go bad... Legacy systems seem to sour like milk"
Bitter: "Carries the consequences of choices we regret"
Sweet: "Well-maintained, well-run functional code"
```

**2. Journey/Geography Metaphor**:
```
"Danger zones on the way to cloud":

The Mists of Confusion
The Mountains of No
The Swamps of Error
```

**3. Architecture/Physical Space**:
```
"Is your technology solution a well behaved house guest?"
```

**4. Apollo 13 (Resilience)**:
```
Uses space mission to illustrate difference between reliability
(Apollo 11 - everything works as planned) and resilience (Apollo 13 -
recovery from unexpected failure)
```

**5. Historical Examples**:
```
"Voyager spacecraft" - to illustrate well-built systems that last
"Photography (Daguerre and Fox Talbot)" - innovation windows
"Winchester Mystery House" - poorly planned architecture
```

**Analogy Pattern**:
- Introduced early (often in title or opening)
- Developed throughout post
- Returned to in conclusion
- Accessible (everyday experiences, well-known examples)
- Multi-layered (reveals new aspects as post develops)

#### C. External References
**Function**: Support claims, direct readers to deeper resources

**Pattern**:
- Usually his own previous posts: "[written before](link)"
- Occasionally books, articles, or concepts: "Conway's Law"
- Rarely: academic papers or technical documentation
- Style: Embedded naturally, not heavy citation

**Examples**:
```
"As I wrote a few weeks ago, technical leadership matters..."

"I've attempted to do a bit of that in the past (in this series of
articles, for example)."
```

**Note**: References are **supportive**, not **proof-based**. David builds arguments through logic and analogy, not through accumulating citations.

#### D. Thought Experiments
**Function**: Help reader experience the problem

**Examples**:

```
"Imagine launching a programme at the beginning of 2020. You would probably
anticipate all the usual challenges: unrealistic plans, stretched budgets,
partners that let you down..."
```

```
"Imagine that I have a coin. It's a normal coin... Now imagine that I also
have a trick coin, which is 75% likely to come up heads..."
```

**Pattern**:
- "Imagine..." followed by concrete scenario
- Builds in complexity gradually
- Ends with question or insight reader can now appreciate

### Evidence Hierarchy

**Most to Least Frequent**:
1. **Analogies** (119) - Primary tool
2. **External references** (105) - Supporting context
3. **Personal experience** (63) - Credibility anchors
4. **Thought experiments** (estimated ~40) - Reader engagement
5. **Data/statistics** (<10) - Rare, used sparingly

**Key Insight**: David's arguments are **experience-and-analogy-based**, not **data-driven**. This suits his purpose: building shared understanding and changing perspectives, not proving empirical claims.

### Templates for Evidence

**Personal experience**:
```
"I have seen/found that [observation]. This suggests [generalization]."
"In my experience, [pattern X] leads to [outcome Y]."
```

**Analogy introduction**:
```
"[Concept] is like [familiar thing]. [Develop parallel]. [Show where
analogy reveals insight]."
```

**Thought experiment**:
```
"Imagine [concrete scenario]. You would probably [expectation]. What you
would not anticipate was [surprise]. [Develop implications]."
```

## 6. CONCLUSION STRENGTH & STYLE

### Statistics
- **Action-oriented conclusions**: 134 posts (74%)
- **Conclusions with humility markers**: 148 posts (82%)
- **Measured tone**: 88 posts (49%)
- **Pattern**: Most conclusions combine action + humility

### Conclusion Types

#### A. Action-Oriented Conclusions
**Markers**: "we should," "we can," "we must," "let us"

**Examples**:

```
"We should explain technology with patience, but we should also explain
it with passion. We should make the case of building more stuff that
matters, and building it well."
```
*[Strong, declarative, parallel structure]*

```
"When we make the case for change, we must not just make the case for
new technology: we must make the case for the practices which will
prevent that new technology from becoming legacy."
```
*[Escalating urgency: "not just... we must"]*

```
"We should train ourselves to think of the technology environment in
the same way as we think of the built environment."
```
*[Clear directive, extended metaphor]*

**Pattern**:
- Imperative mood ("should," "must")
- Collective ("we," not "you")
- Specific actions, not vague aspirations
- Often builds in intensity

#### B. Humble/Qualified Conclusions
**Markers**: "perhaps," "maybe," "might," "could," "possibly," "may be"

**Examples**:

```
"I am sure that there are better models, but this simple set of 5 Ps
helps me make sense of a complex field: I hope some readers will find
it helpful too."
```
*[Acknowledges limitations, offers personal utility]*

```
"This list is, of course, not exhaustive, and won't fit everybody's
style. However, I offer these wholly unoriginal bits of advice in the
same spirit that they were offered to me."
```
*[Multiple humility markers: "not exhaustive," "won't fit everybody,"
"wholly unoriginal"]*

```
"Of course, this may be another dangerous 'just': we just need to
change the way we treat teams managing legacy systems."
```
*[Self-aware about oversimplification]*

**Pattern**:
- Acknowledges complexity
- Admits limitations of argument
- Personal voice ("I hope," "I believe")
- Still forward-looking despite reservations

#### C. Measured Conclusions
**Markers**: "careful," "consider," "think about," "reflect," "remember"

**Examples**:

```
"Today, we should think through the implications of the advances we
make, and exercise patience before we judge them: their advantages
may not be immediately apparent."
```
*[Calls for reflection, not immediate action]*

```
"It's a privilege and a wonder to be able to go back to the origins
of innovations in this way, to stand on the spot where they happened."
```
*[Contemplative, appreciative tone]*

```
"The question is not whether you or someone else will fall into one
or more of these patches of swampy ground, it's what you do when
they do."
```
*[Reframes problem rather than solving it]*

**Pattern**:
- Focuses on mindset, not just action
- Encourages reflection
- Patient tone
- Long-term perspective

### Combination Patterns

**Most Common**: Action + Humility (65% of posts)

**Example**:
```
"I believe that we can show that complexity and simplicity are
compatible.

_(Views in this article are my own.)_"
```
*[Confident assertion + immediate disclaimer]*

**Example**:
```
"Perhaps we can avoid expensive, risky replacement projects. Of course,
this may be another dangerous 'just': we just need to change the way
we treat teams managing legacy systems. But this feels like a just which
is well within the power of most technology teams."
```
*[Hope → self-doubt → measured confidence]*

### Closing Devices

#### 1. Return to Opening Question

**Example from "Three Flavours of Legacy"**:
```
Opening: "What does legacy technology taste like?"
Closing: "What does your legacy taste like?"
```

#### 2. Restate Framework with All Elements

**Example from "Coping with Volatility"**:
```
"In the world of technology, volatility is a feature, not a bug. We
have known that since the first articulation of Moore's law. There is
always more volatility to come - and always reason to avoid panic,
seek truth and release frequently."
```
*[Restates all three principles in closing sentence]*

#### 3. Meta-Reflection on the Argument

**Example from "Five Pieces of Advice"**:
```
"I find that any day when I have managed not to panic, been reminded
that my team are smarter than me, have learnt something from them,
lived up to my role as a leader in my organisation, and reminded
people of the value of technologists, is a good day in the office."
```
*[Reframes principles as daily practice]*

#### 4. Universal Disclaimer

**Every Single Post Ends**:
```
_(Views in this article are my own.)_
```

**Function**:
- Legal/professional safety
- Humility signal
- Separates personal insight from institutional position
- Consistent brand marker

### Conclusion Templates

**Confident action**:
```
"We should [action 1], but we should also [action 2]. [Broader
implication]."
```

**Humble offering**:
```
"I am sure that there are better [models/approaches/answers], but
[this approach] helps me [benefit]. I hope some readers will find
it helpful too."
```

**Measured synthesis**:
```
"[Restate the core tension/problem]. However, I believe that
[resolution]. [Specific recommendation with qualification]."
```

**Circular return**:
```
[Return to opening question/metaphor, now answerable with framework
provided in the post]
```

**Always end with**:
```
_(Views in this article are my own.)_
```

## 7. REPETITION & EMPHASIS

### Statistics
- **Anaphora examples found**: ~35 instances across posts
- **"If your motivation is..." pattern**: 5 instances in one post
- **Repeated sentence starts**: Found in 70% of posts

### Repetition Techniques

#### A. Anaphora (Repeated Sentence Starts)

**Example 1: "If your motivation" Pattern**

From "Old is not bad":
```
If your motivation for modernisation is simply to have something new,
remember that it will get old too.

If your motivation for modernisation is simply to have code in one
language rather than another language, think carefully about what
advantages this gives you.

If your motivation for modernisation is to make people want to work on
your core systems, then you need to think about how you make that work
interesting and valued - legacy or not.

If your motivation for modernisation is a lack of skills, think hard
about the skills you want to build...

If your motivation for modernisation is speed and agility, make sure
that you build with a focus on code quality, readability and test
coverage.
```

**Structure**:
- 5 parallel "If your motivation" clauses
- Each addresses different (wrong) reason for modernization
- Each ends with cautionary advice
- Creates exhaustive feeling: "I've thought of all your reasons"
- Builds to right answer (implied: none of these are sufficient)

**Example 2: "What if" Pattern**

From "The Human Path to Legacy Modernisation":
```
What if we invested instead in changing the way our legacy teams work?

What if we put them first rather than last when adopting practices
such as Agile or DevOps?

What if we gave the teams that run legacy systems the freedom and
capacity to manage their pipeline of work and spend time on refactoring
and reliability?
```

**Structure**:
- Three "What if" questions
- Each more specific than the last
- Builds alternative vision
- Invitation to imagine differently

**Example 3: "I believe" Pattern**

From "What if we behaved as if we cared":
```
I believe that all of these reactions are reasonable but wrong...

I believe that we need to do more than just take the time to explain...

I believe that this is a waste of some of the smartest, most talented
and most energetic people...
```

**Structure**:
- Establishes conviction
- Each "I believe" stakes out stronger claim
- Personal authority through repetition

#### B. Structural Repetition Across Sections

**Example: Three Danger Zones Pattern**

```
**The Mists of Confusion**
[Development]
In this case, persistence requires patience.

**The Mountains of No**
[Development]
In this case, persistence requires diligence.

**The Swamps of Error**
[Development]
In this case, persistence requires generosity.
```

**Pattern**:
- Parallel section headers (metaphorical)
- Parallel closing sentences ("In this case, persistence requires X")
- Creates rhythm and expectation
- Final element becomes memorable through pattern

**Example: "First, Second, Third" Pattern**

From "5 Ps: Ingredients for Technology Success":
```
First, I think that the platform and product distinction is key...

Second, people appear twice!

Third, performance and practices are a function of teams...
```

**Pattern**:
- Explicit numbering
- Builds case point by point
- Each point roughly equal weight
- Signals "these are my main arguments"

#### C. Key Phrase Repetition

**Example: "Don't Panic"**

Appears across multiple posts:
```
"Don't panic" (2023 post title)
"Don't Panic" (section header in 2025 post)
"First piece of advice: Don't panic"
```

**Function**:
- Creates through-line across posts
- Becomes recognizable brand phrase
- Douglas Adams reference (adds humor + cultural cache)

**Example: "Room and Respect"**

From "Give Your Legacy Teams Room and Respect":
```
Title includes both terms
"Room" section develops first concept
"Respect" section develops second concept
Conclusion: "room and respect"
```

**Function**:
- Paired concepts (alliterative)
- Easy to remember and cite
- Becomes shorthand for full argument

#### D. Parallel Construction

**Example from conclusions**:
```
"avoid panic, seek truth and release frequently"

"patience, diligence, and generosity"

"sour, bitter, and sweet"
```

**Pattern**:
- Three elements
- Grammatically parallel (all nouns, all verbs, all adjectives)
- Rhythmically balanced
- Memorable through structure

### Emphasis Through Variation

**Not all repetition - David also uses variation for emphasis**:

**Example: Sentence Length Variation**
```
[Long complex sentence with multiple clauses.]

[Another long sentence developing the point.]

And then short.

Very short.

[Return to longer explanation.]
```

**Example: Italics for Emphasis**
```
Regular text explaining concept.

"Embedded dialogue or _key term_ within flow."

Regular text.
```

**Pattern**:
- Italics for: dialogue, foreign phrases, key terms, emphasis
- Not overused (selective emphasis)

### Templates for Repetition

**Anaphoric series**:
```
[Repeated phrase] [variation 1].
[Repeated phrase] [variation 2].
[Repeated phrase] [variation 3].
[Optional: Repeated phrase] [variation 4].
```

**Structural parallel**:
```
**[Header 1]**
[Development]
[Closing formula A]

**[Header 2]**
[Development]
[Closing formula A with variation]

**[Header 3]**
[Development]
[Closing formula A with variation]
```

**Key phrase repetition**:
```
[Introduce phrase in title or opening]
[Develop in body]
[Return to phrase in conclusion]
```
