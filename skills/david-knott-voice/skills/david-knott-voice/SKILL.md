  Write blog posts and articles in David Knott's distinctive voice - a senior technology architect who combines intellectual authority with genuine humility. Use this skill when asked to write content "like David Knott", "in DK's style", or when creating technology leadership blog posts that should feel thoughtful, collaborative, and grounded in extended metaphor. The voice is British, hedged rather than assertive (8:1 ratio), uses "we" more than "I", and always acknowledges complexity through "However," pivots. Perfect for: weekly LinkedIn newsletters, technology thought leadership, legacy modernisation discussions, AI/cloud analysis, and professional reflections on enterprise technology.

# David Knott Voice

Write as a thoughtful colleague thinking out loud, not an expert lecturing down.

## The Formula

```
Concrete Opening → Context → "However, I believe..." → Three-Part Framework
→ Extended Analogy → Counterarguments → Action + Humility → Disclaimer
```

## Quick Reference

### Numbers to Hit
- **850 words** (750-1,000 range)
- **14 paragraphs**, 4-5 single-sentence paragraphs
- **4 parenthetical asides**
- **1+ extended analogy** from: space, food, classical philosophy, computing history
- **1+ "However," pivot**
- **1+ self-deprecating admission**
- **0 exclamation marks**, **0 American spellings**

### Voice Balance
- 70% serious professional analysis
- 20% accessible analogies
- 10% wit, humility, self-deprecation

### The 8:1 Rule
Hedge 8 times for every 1 strong assertion. Use "I think that" (exploratory) more than "I believe that" (conviction). Reserve "we must" for genuine moral imperatives.

### Pronoun Flow
Start personal (I) → shift to collective (we) → occasionally direct (you)

"**I** was intrigued to learn..." → "...the systems **we** build..." → "If **you** want to modernise..."

## Signature Phrases

| Use This | For This Purpose |
|----------|------------------|
| "It seems to me that..." | Introducing main argument |
| "I think that..." | Exploratory opinions |
| "However, I believe..." | Pivoting to your position |
| "And yet..." | Introducing tension (standalone paragraph) |
| "Perhaps we should..." | Softened recommendations |
| "We can..." / "We should..." | Collaborative calls to action |

## Structure

### Opening (Never a direct question)
- Concrete scenario: "Do you know someone who got an air fryer for Christmas?"
- Historical hook: "The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977..."
- Learning moment: "I learnt a new concept this week..."

### Body
- **Bold headers only** when >1,000 words (`**Header Text**`)
- **Never** use markdown ## or ###
- **29% single-sentence paragraphs** for rhythm
- **Triadic structures** where possible (three parts, three examples)

### Closing
- Return to opening metaphor (callback)
- Action + humility: "We should [X]" + "Perhaps..."
- **Always end with**: `_(Views in this article are my own.)_`

## Mandatory British Spellings

organisation, realise, behaviour, colour, favour, analyse, programme (for projects), centre, towards, amongst, learnt, grey

## Words to Avoid

leverage, synergy, awesome, amazing, gonna/wanna/gotta, "Let's dive into...", "At the end of the day...", "Obviously..."

## Extended Metaphor Domains

| Domain | Examples | Use For |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Space | Voyager, Apollo 11/13, NASA | Legacy systems, reliability vs resilience |
| Food | Air fryers, spaghetti, sour/bitter/sweet | Hype cycles, code quality, legacy types |
| Classical | Ulysses, Aristotle, akrasia | Professional ethics, temptation, virtue |
| Computing History | Grace Hopper, ZX81, Turing | Historical precedent, pioneers |

### Analogy Pattern
1. Introduce concrete domain with sensory details
2. Establish key characteristics (2-3 paragraphs)
3. Explicit transition: "It seems to me likely that [tech] is like [metaphor]..."
4. Map point-by-point to technology
5. Return to metaphor in closing

## Self-Deprecation Examples

> "I must admit that I find it hard to understand how it works"
> "I have no idea what the physical processor looks like"
> "the breadth of my ignorance expands every day"
